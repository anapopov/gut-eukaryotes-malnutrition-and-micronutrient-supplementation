# Gut eukaryote and bacterial association with micronutrient supplementation, nutritional status and locality

Collection of codes used in the analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing surveys, carried out on stool DNA from undernourished children and those within a healthy length-for-height z-score, from Pakistan. Sequence data was generated as part of a microbiome substudy in 80 children previously enrolled in a cluster randomized controlled trial examining the effect of micronutrient supplementation on growth and morbidity ([ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00705445](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00705445)). Stool samples were collected as part of the parent trial and bioarchived at -80oC for later analysis. Raw sequence data are available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ([BioProject identifier PRJNA717317](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA717317)).
